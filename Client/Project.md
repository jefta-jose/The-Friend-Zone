Here's a detailed plan for your **Full-Stack Social Media Dashboard** project, covering both the front-end and back-end:

### 1. Project Structure Overview

**Front-end:**
- Framework: Vanilla JavaScript or React (React recommended for scalability).
- Features: 
  - Dashboard for users to create, like, comment, and share posts.
  - User authentication (login, register, password recovery).
  - Post interaction (CRUD operations).
  - Real-time notifications for likes, comments, and shares.

**Back-end:**
- Framework: Node.js with Express.
- REST API for handling:
  - User authentication (login, register, password recovery).
  - CRUD operations for posts (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - Real-time notifications using WebSockets or server-sent events.
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for user and post data storage.

### 2. Detailed Breakdown and Plan

#### **Front-end (React)**

**Components:**
- `App`: Main component handling routing and overall state.
- `Login`: User authentication page (login/register/password recovery).
- `Dashboard`: Main social media dashboard for creating, viewing, liking, commenting, and sharing posts.
- `Post`: Component to render a single post with options for like, comment, and share.
- `Notifications`: Real-time notifications for post interactions.

**Steps:**
1. **Setup React App:**
   - Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap the React project.
   - Setup routing using `react-router` for navigation (Login, Dashboard, etc.).

2. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
   - Handle login, registration, and password recovery.

3. **CRUD Operations for Posts:**
   - Create forms for adding and editing posts.
   - Display all posts on the dashboard.
   - Add buttons for liking, commenting, and sharing posts.

4. **Real-time Notifications:**
   - Use WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) to push notifications for interactions (likes, comments, shares) in real-time.

#### **Back-end (Node.js + Express)**

**API Endpoints:**
- **Authentication:**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Login an existing user.
  - `POST /api/auth/recover`: Password recovery.
  
- **Post Management (CRUD Operations):**
  - `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post.
  - `GET /api/posts`: Get all posts.
  - `GET /api/posts/:id`: Get a single post by ID.
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id`: Update a post.
  - `DELETE /api/posts/:id`: Delete a post.

- **Post Interactions:**
  - `POST /api/posts/:id/like`: Like a post.
  - `POST /api/posts/:id/comment`: Comment on a post.
  - `POST /api/posts/:id/share`: Share a post.

- **Real-time Notifications:**
  - Use WebSockets (`socket.io`) or SSE for real-time notifications when a user likes, comments, or shares a post.

**Steps:**
1. **Set Up Express App:**
   - Initialize the project using `npm init` and install necessary dependencies (`express`, `mongoose` or `pg`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, etc.).

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Create models for `User` and `Post`.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication using `jsonwebtoken` and password hashing with `bcrypt`.

3. **CRUD Operations for Posts:**
   - Set up routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
   - Ensure each post is linked to a user.

4. **Real-time Notifications:**
   - Integrate WebSockets (`socket.io`) or SSE to notify users in real-time when their posts receive likes, comments, or shares.

5. **Database Setup:**
   - Use MongoDB (via Mongoose) or PostgreSQL (via Sequelize/pg) to store user and post data.
   - Store user information (username, email, password) and posts (content, author, likes, comments).

### 3. Tech Stack and Dependencies

**Front-end:**
- **React** (or Vanilla JS)
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the back-end API.
- **Socket.IO Client**: For WebSocket communication (if WebSockets are used).
- **React Router**: For handling navigation.

**Back-end:**
- **Node.js** + **Express**: Server-side framework.
- **Mongoose** (for MongoDB) or **Sequelize** (for PostgreSQL): ORM/ODM for database interactions.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time notifications (or use server-sent events).
- **JWT** (`jsonwebtoken`): For user authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt** (`bcryptjs` or `bcrypt`): For password hashing.
- **Cors** (`cors`): Middleware for handling cross-origin requests.


### 4. Next Steps

Start by:
1. Bootstrapping the React front-end using `create-react-app`.
2. Setting up the Node.js + Express back-end with basic user authentication and CRUD functionality.
3. Adding real-time notifications after basic features are working.

USERS TABLE DETAILS

For a **users table** in a social media project, you might want to include the following fields:

### Basic Information
1. **user_id** (Primary Key) – A unique identifier for each user.
2. **username** – The user's chosen display name.
3. **email** – For account verification and login.
4. **password_hash** – Encrypted password for security.
5. **phone_number** (Optional) – For two-factor authentication or contact.
6. **profile_picture_url** – Link to the user's profile picture.
7. **bio** – A short description or introduction of the user.
8. **website_url** (Optional) – Personal or professional website.

### Account Management
9. **created_at** – Timestamp for when the account was created.
10. **updated_at** – Timestamp for the last profile update.
11. **last_login** – Timestamp of the user's last login.
12. **is_active** – Boolean to indicate if the account is active.
13. **is_verified** – Boolean to show if the account has been verified.

### Social Features
14. **followers_count** – Number of users following this user.
15. **following_count** – Number of users this user follows.
16. **posts_count** – Number of posts made by the user.

### Privacy and Security
17. **is_private** – Boolean to indicate if the user's account is private.
18. **two_factor_enabled** – Boolean to show if two-factor authentication is enabled.
